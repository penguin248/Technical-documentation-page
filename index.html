        <p>
          Python is a high-level, dynamically typed programming language known
          for its simplicity and readability. Developed by Guido van Rossum in
          the late 1980s, Python has gained immense popularity in various
          domains, including web development, data analysis, machine learning,
          and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          It emphasizes code readability and a clean, easy-to-understand syntax,
          making it an excellent choice for both beginners and experienced
          programmers. To get started with Python, you can download and install
          it from the official website (python.org) or use a Python distribution
          like Anaconda for data science applications.

        <p>
          Python offers a wide range of data types, including integers, floats,
          strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Variables allow you to
          store and manipulate data, while operators and expressions enable you
          to perform mathematical and logical operations.

        <header>Functions and Modules</header>
        <p>
          In Python, you can define functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of
          code. Functions can have parameters and return values, enhancing code
          modularity and reusability. Python's standard library provides
          numerous modules that offer pre-built functionality, while you can
          also create your own custom modules to organize your code efficiently.

      <section class="main-section" id="Object-Oriented_Programming">
        <header>Object-Oriented Programming</header>
        <p>
          Python supports object-oriented programming, allowing you to create
          and manipulate objects with attributes and methods. Classes serve as
          blueprints for objects, facilitating code organization and reuse.
          Inheritance and polymorphism enable you to create hierarchies of
          related classes and achieve code flexibility.
        </p>
        <code
          >class Person: def __init__(self, name, age): self.name = name
          self.age = age def greet(self): return f"Hello, my name is {self.name}
          and I am {self.age} years old."

        <header>File Handling</header>
        <p>
          Python provides robust file handling capabilities for reading from and
          writing to files. You can work with both text and binary files using
          the built-in open() function, and Python's context managers make it
          easy to handle resources efficiently.
        </p>
        <code
          ># Writing to a text file with open("example.txt", "w") as file:
          file.write("Hello, this is a sample text.\n")</code
        >
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Exception_Handling">
        <header>Exception Handling</header>
        <p>
          In Python, exceptions are used to handle runtime errors gracefully.
          You can catch and handle exceptions using try and except blocks, which
          allows your program to recover from errors and continue executing.
          Python also supports raising custom exceptions to provide meaningful
          error messages.
        </p>
        <code
          ># Handling multiple exceptions try: value = int("abc") # ValueError:
          invalid literal for int() except ValueError as e: print(f"ValueError:
          {e}") except Exception as e: print(f"An unexpected error occurred:
          {e}")

        <p>
          Python's extensive ecosystem includes a wealth of libraries and
          frameworks that extend its capabilities. Libraries like NumPy for
          numerical computing, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for
          data visualization are widely used in data science. In web
          development, Flask and Django are popular frameworks for building web
          applications.
        </p>
        <code
          >import numpy as np # Creating a NumPy array arr = np.array([1, 2, 3,
          4, 5])

        <p>
          To write maintainable Python code, it's essential to follow best
          practices and coding conventions outlined in PEP 8, Python's style
          guide. Writing clean and readable code not only aids collaboration but
          also eases debugging.
